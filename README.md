# Project: Investigating Movie Data (1960 - 2015)

## Introduction
For this project, I examined the TMDB-movies data set. I was particularly interested in genres and when movies were released. I decided to pursue the data set with the following two questions: 
Which genres are most common from year to year?
Which quarter generates the most movies in the popular top10 in our data set?

## Conclusions
## Research Question 1: Which genres are most common from year to year?

From the bar graph above, we can see that year to year, the most popular genre is drama followed by comedy. In my analysis, I defined the "most popular genre" as the genre that the most number of movies associate themselves with.

From my year-to-year analysis of genres, most movies are released in the drama genre, followed by comedy. It seems like if a genre exceeds 13% of all movies released that year, it will have a high chance of being the most common genre in that year.

## Research Question 2: Which quarter generates the most movies in the popular top10 in our data set?

From the quarterly analysis of the top 10 movies of each year, the most popular movies are usually released in quarters 2 and 4. When doing this analysis, I was hoping to find when is the best quarter to release movies if I was a producer. From the analysis, it seems like quarters 2 and 4 are popular period to release top movies. However, I think there are a lot more variables at play here than just release date. A movie may be released in a quarter and do well in subsequent quarters, or maybe there are lack of good movies in subsequent quarters that result in a movie in the previous quarter to gain the top 10 spot. Although not definitive, it seems like quarter 1 is the least likely period to have a movie in the top 10.

Details of the analysis can be found with the attached Jupyter and .csv file.
